## Raspberry Pi Deadite

Inspired by the infamous Evil Dead's Ash Williams nemesis, this project is a step by step tutorial
 to build a head moving robot (mine will be a skull), with face recognition and some form of
 text-to-speech command.

 Initial environment building material is on [medium.com/@jscdroiddev](https://medium.com/@jscdroiddev/virtual-development-environment-for-raspberry-pi-gpio-programming-part-1-b8d76994e368) (Part 1) but will be moved to the Instructables or other place soon, along with part 2 and the latest breadboard to control 2 servos (or up to 8) with the SC08a controller.
